            I conceived and delivered a working prototype as a proof of concept inside of two weeks. I led and managed the team that then fleshed this concept into an off the shelf solution to generate and manage leads from long form content marketing. The product we built enabled customers to achieve conversion rate increases of 122-200%, and secured us a 6 month up front contract with GFK.

            While at Fruitbowl, a client came to us with a problem. We immediately saw the resell value in the solution and spun it out into its own startup: Virally, a lead generation tool for companies with downloadable content marketing. It uses social network authentication to easily and seamlessly submit users' details in return for valuable downloadable content.

          %p
            My cofounder and I realized it was heading in a direction that we weren't passionate about, and had limited long term sustainability issues with increased public awareness around privacy and personal data. We both sold our stake in Virally to our investors to start Trakio.

            I built and maintained several key systems including the University's password reset system, on boarding for new students and online maps. I successfully managed the implementation and launch of the University's student fee gateway by a 3rd party vendor, a service that processes tens of millions of dollars worth of tuition each year. I oversaw the transition of the main marketing site's web framework, a key component of the University's web presence, to this team. I led the adoption of agile processes, working to refine a scrum based process that allowed us to be an agile team within a slow and bureaucratic department. I implemented and consulted on several user experience improvements across various teams and services which contributed to a raise in our student satisfaction rating, the key performance metric for our department.

            I am most proud of the transition the team made during the time that I worked there, and my contribution to that transition. When I started we were a poorly performing team with very little coherence, struggling to deal with the bureaucracy of the wider organization. By the time I left we had implemented continuous improvement and evolved our own flavor of agile scrum that allowed us to function most effectively given the constraints of the environment in which we operated.

            I lead the work of translating an established print based design and branding to the web for use across a range of uses and departments. I implemented that design into a flexible PHP/CSS based template that was successfully rolled out across dozens of departments and publishers managing content on <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk" target="_blank">https://www.kent.ac.uk</a>. I successfully project managed the adoption of site template upgrades for several large departments, and account managed several others. I was promoted twice during my two years in this team.

            Given how long I'd been experimenting with web technologies for, my university studies did little to challenge me and so I found a part time job for the University as a designer/developer in their fledgling Departmental Web Support Team. We worked with departmental web teams to deliver their web sites under a consistent brand.

          %p
            Early on I was given the opportunity to work on creating a standardized template that could be used across the large number of academic and nonacademic departments. I was the main designer and developer on the first 3 generations of this centralized template. And contributed to later versions of the framework as a senior developer as part of a larger team.

          %p
            I progressed within the team, starting as a part time junior designer to working full time hours as a senior designer/developer. As a senior, I was responsible for mentoring and supervising junior staff and project managing the development of departmental web projects.

            Over the years that I worked on the system we evolved it into to a PHP framework that allowed departmental editors to write HTML in Dreamweaver as they were used to. We would post process their HTML to build advanced dynamic UI elements that would not otherwise be possible with Dreamweaver alone.

          A course that can be described as computer science with an emphasis on graphic design and web technologies. It perfectly suited my interests in both the aesthetic design, and the underlying programming of software.

          An interactive Flash application presented on a DVD data disk. With farewell messages, photo galleries, videos and easter eggs. Developed and produced during my last year of high school, mostly for the love of it, but with a nice little profit at the end.

            The web back then wasn't what it is now, and I was frustrated with the limited interactivity of web pages, so I turned to the only place there was to turn in 2003: Macromedia Flash!

          %p
            Along with two like minded friends we finished the project on time and made ourselves some beer money for the summer. Most importantly though, I learned things that were far more valuable given my future in software engineering than anything I learnt in class.

          Operation Flashpoint Released
          %small.dates Summer 2001

        %p.summary
          Writing custom mission scripts for Operation Flashpoint was what first really got me into programming. I probably would have found my calling with out this game but even so I owe a lot to it for first igniting my passion for programming.

        .more-details
          %p
            When I purchased a copy of Operation Flashpoint it was as "just another game" but when I discovered the scriptable mission editor I was hooked. I'd used PHP before but only as a templating language, this was something else entirely. I could make characters move across the virtual map engaging each other at my whim, I was hooked!

          %p
            From here I started exploring more and more of the potential of PHP as a programming language. Building the foundation for a passion for making things, which is as strong today as ever.

          My high school education lacked any formal programming education but that didn't stop me learning. I spent a lot of (my teachers will say too much) time tinkering away on my own web projects.

        .more-details

          %p
            The Royal Hospital School, is an income assessed private boarding school with a strong naval tradition. Boarding with boys and girls from a wide range of backgrounds has given me many insights and oppotunities I simply would not have had access to at any other school.

          %p
            Extra curricular activities like the Combined Cadet Force and the Duke of Edinburgh Award have provided me with the skills and resilience to prepare and deal with most of what life has had to throw at me.

          %p
            Boarding from the early age of 12 and being away from my family has meant that from an early age I have had the self discipline and independence to work well on my own. Whilst the comradery and nature of boarding have instilled a great appreciation for working as part of a team.

        %p
          I've been playing around with the web since my Uncle gave me a web development magazine with a free version of HotMetal PRO on the accompanying demo disc (in the days when demo discs were still a thing). This introduced me to the thrilling world of marques, frames and animated GIF buttons.

          %h3 Other Interests
          %p
            I understand the importance of a balanced lifestyle, and have many interests beyond software development. Here's how I like to recharge:

          %h4 Being a Dad
          %p
            I say being a Dad but really I mean vicariously reliving my childhood, going to scouts and playing Lego.

          %h4 Building Models
          %p
            At my core I like to build things, building software is incredibly rewarding but sometimes it's nice to work on something physical.

          %h4 Hiking &amp; Bouldering
          %p
            I love being outside and away from the city. Southern California has so much to offer close by and I'm just starting to scratch the surface.

          %h4 Snow sports
          %p
            I'm a proficient skier and a distinctly average boarder. California wasn't the best move for snow sports but one day I'll make it back to the slopes.

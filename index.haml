            I've spent the last two and a half years working on Trakio, helping companies increase activation and reduce churn by understanding their users better. In that time we have executed a number of pivots searching for a repeatable and scalable business model. Each time creating hypotheses and testing them.

          %p
            As the lead engineer I have been responsible for building, managing and documenting several production services and client libraries from scratch. I implemented the provisioning of our hardware infrastructure on AWS using Chef, along with service monitoring and redundancy, having had no previous experience of SysAdmin. I recruited and managed all our technical employees and contractors, managing their on boarding, training, and providing direction and mentorship for their personal development. Utilizing online tools to collaborate remotely, often across timezones.

            Any attempt to try and distill this journey into a few paragraphs would fail to do it justice. If you would like to hear more about my experience I would love to dissect it with you, in person.

          %p
            Working on Trakio has been the single most informative period of my life. Coming to San Francisco, interviewing for YC, taking part in the Alchemist Accelerator, experiencing nacho "cheese", the people I have met, the lessons I have learned. It has been eye opening to say the least.

            I conceived and delivered a working prototype as a proof of concept inside of two weeks. I led and managed the team that then fleshed this concept into an off the shelf solution to generate and manage leads from long form content marketing. The product we built enabled customers to achieve conversion rate increases of 122-200%, and secured us a 6 month up front contract with GFK. Both myself and my cofounder sold our stakes to pursue other ideas.

            While at Fruitbowl, a client came to us with a problem. We immediately saw the resell value in the solution and spun it out into its own startup: Virally, a lead generation tool for companies with downloadable content marketing. It uses social network authentication to easily and seemlessly submit users' details in return for valuable downloadable content.

          %p
            My cofounder and I realised it was heading in a direction that we weren't passionate about. We both sold our stake in Virally to our investors to start Trakio.

            I built and maintained several key systems including the University's password reset system, on boarding for new students and online maps. I successfully managed the implementation and launch of the University's student fee gateway by a 3rd party vendor, a service that processes tens of millions of pounds in tuition each year. I oversaw the transition of the main marketing site's web framework, a key component of the University's web presence, to this team. I led the adoption of agile processes, working to refine a scrum based process that allowed us to be an agile team within a slow and bureaucratic department. I implemented and consulted on several user experience improvements across various teams and services which contributed to a raise in our student satisfaction rating, the key performance metric for our department.

            I am most proud of the transition the team made during the time that I worked there, and my contribution to that transition. When I started we were a poorly performing team with very little coherence, struggling to deal with the bureaucracy of the wider organization. By the time I left we had implemented continuous improvement and evolved our own flavor of agile scrum that allowed us to function most effectively given the constraints of the environment in which we operated.

            I was key in translating an established print based design and branding to the web for use across a range of and departments. I implemented that design into a flexible PHP/CSS based template that was successfully rolled out across dozens of departments and publishers managing content on www.kent.ac.uk, a site that receives tens of thousands of visits a month. I successfully project managed the adoption of site template upgrades for several large departments, and account managed several others. I was promoted twice during my two years in this team.

            Given how long I'd been experimenting with web technologies for, my university studies did little to challenge me and so I found a part time job for the University as a designer/developer in their fledgling Departmental Web Support Team. We worked with departmental web teams to deliver their web sites under a consistent brand.

          %p
            Early on I was given the opportunity to work on creating a standardized template that could be used across the large number of academic and nonacademic departments. I was the main designer and developer on the first 3 generations of this centralized template. And contributed to later versions of the framework as a senior developer as part of a larger team.

          %p
            I progressed within the team, starting as a part time junior designer to working full time hours as a senior designer/developer. As a senior, I was responsible for mentoring and supervising junior staff and project managing the development of departmental web projects.

            Over the years that I worked on the system we evolved it into to a PHP framework that allowed departmental editors to write HTML in Dreamweaver as they were used to. We would post process their HTML to build advanced dynamic UI elements that would not othewise be possible with dreamweaver alone.

            When I purchased a copy of Operation Flashpoint it was as "just another game" but when I discovered the scriptable mission editor I was hooked. I'd used PHP before but only as a templating language, this was something else entirely. I could make characters move across the virtual map engaging each other at my whim, I was hooked!

        %p
          I've been playing around with the web since my Uncle gave me a web development magazine with a free version of a WYSIWYG editor on the accompanying demo disc (in the days when demo discs were still a thing). It was so long ago now that I can't even remember the name of the software, but what I do remember is the thrilling world of marques, frames and animated GIF buttons (these were also still
          a thing) that it introduced me to.

          %h3 Other Interests
          %p
            I understand the importance of a balanced lifestyle, and have many interests beyond software development, here are a few:

          %h4 Learning Spanish
          %p
            My girl friend is Mexican American and as part of an effort to learn about her heritage and culture I am learning Spanish. Apparently I need to be fluent before we have children!

          %h4 Keeping Fit
          %p
            Last year I hit my target of a combined 1000lbs total across, bench press, dead lift and back squat. I'm now working towards rowing a marathon.

          %h4 Lacrosse
          %p
            I'm a casual lacrosse player to say the least, but for what I need: some where to blow off some steam and relax, it is perfect.

          %h4 Snow sports
          %p
            I'm a proficient skier and a distinctly average boarder, I try to get a week on the snow in at least once a year.
